## AskLens

AskLens is a decentralized app built on top of LensProtocol that lets users post questions and answer questions.

The primary focus of AskLens is to facilitate learning and knowledge sharing. It is a place where people can ask questions and get answers from the community.

### The Feed

Your AskLens feed will be specifically curated with questions that others using the app or tagging their post with #AskLens.

In the future, you'll be able to search different topics like Web Development, Web3 Security, Community Management, etc.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
